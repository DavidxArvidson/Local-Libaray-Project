# Local-Library-Project

This local library project is a collection of JavaScript functions to be used on the website of an imaginary local library. They enable visitors to browse through the inventory of the library by user account, author, or book ID. 

This project was developed as an assignment for the Thinkful.com software engineering course.

My contributions were made using JavaScript.
